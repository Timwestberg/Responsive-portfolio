                    <p>
                        My name is Tim Westberg. I am currently in-training to become a full stack developer. My primary work skills up to this point
                        are in the field of bookkeeping, sales, and business administration. However I have been interested
                        in coding since I was 15; I dabbled in game code, mainly picking apart files and seeing what changed
                        within the application. My curiosity grew over the years as I gained more exposure to web development.
                        This early exposure prompted my enrollment in the UCSD coding bootcamp. My goal is to build effective,
                        solid web applications that effectively manage and operate the vast amount of data small business
                        receive every day.
